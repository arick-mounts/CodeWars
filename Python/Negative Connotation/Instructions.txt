You will be given a string with sets of characters seperated by spaces (i.e. words).

Looking at the first letter of each word (case insensitive-"A" and "a" should be treated the same), you need to determine whether it falls into the positive/first half of the alphabet ("a"-"m") or the negative/second half ("n"-"z").

Return True if there are more (or equal) positive words than negative words, False otherwise.

"A big brown fox caught a bad rabbit" => True
"Xylophones can obtain Xenon." => False
